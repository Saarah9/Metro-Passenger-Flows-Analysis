# Metro-Passenger-Flows-Analysis
This project analyzes the factors affecting metro passenger flows across cities worldwide. It uses data from the World Metro Database and includes statistical computations, visualizations, and insights into metro systems.  
## Objectives  
- Identify key factors influencing metro passenger flows.  
- Visualize relationships between these factors and annual ridership.  
- Derive insights to explain differences in metro ridership among cities.
## Tasks  
### 1. Scatterplot: Metro System Size vs. Annual Ridership  
- Visualize the relationship between the number of stations and annual ridership.  
- Analyze how system size influences passenger flow.  

### 2. Scatterplot: Metro System Age vs. Annual Ridership  
- Plot system age against annual ridership.  
- Assess whether older systems attract more passengers.  

### 3. Box Plot: Annual Metro Ridership by Region  
- Create a box plot to compare ridership across different regions.  
- Highlight significant variations.  

### 4. Scatterplot: System Length vs. Annual Ridership  
- Analyze the impact of system length on passenger flows.  

### 5. Additional Factors  
- Discuss other variables (e.g., fares, population density) that could affect ridership.  

## Libraries Used  
- `pandas`  
- `plotly`  

## Visualizations  
- Interactive visualizations are created using `plotly` for clear and dynamic insights.  

## How to Run  
1. Install `pandas` and `plotly`:  
   ```bash  
   pip install pandas plotly
